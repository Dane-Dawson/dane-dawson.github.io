# Dane Dawson | Full-Stack Developer & Renaissance Man

A high-fidelity portfolio engineered with a focus on **Neo-Glassmorphism**, **Reactive State Management**, and **AI-Augmented UX**. This site serves as a technical showcase of modern web architecture and a curated look into my career path as a "Renaissance Man"—from Software Engineer Coach to professional performer.

## 🏗 System Architecture & Features

### **1. Bleeding-Edge Tech Stack**

* **React 19 & Vite 7**: Leveraging the latest concurrent rendering features and lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
* **AI Integration**: Powered by the **Google Generative AI SDK** for dynamic, intelligent content generation.
* **Type-Safe Development**: Fully implemented in **TypeScript 5.9** to ensure robust component props and state handling.
* **Audio-Visual UX**: Integrated `use-sound` for a multi-sensory experience and `@tsparticles` for immersive, high-performance background physics.

### **2. The Work History Engine (`jobRandomizer`)**

Rather than a static list, the home page features a custom-built randomization engine.

* **Logic**: A TypeScript-driven algorithm that pulls from an array of 22+ diverse professional roles (e.g., **Software Engineer Coach**, **Glass Blower**, **Santa**, and **Tuba Player**).
* **State Management**: Uses React `useState` to pair randomized roles with witty, context-aware commentary.

### **3. Responsive Glassmorphism & Motion UI**

* **Neo-Glass Aesthetic**: Achieved via custom CSS3 `backdrop-filter` and RGBA alpha-blending for a futuristic, translucent look.
* **Advanced Motion**: Orchestrated with **Framer Motion** for fluid, physics-based transitions and layout animations.
* **Data & Content**: Dynamic rendering of markdown via `react-markdown` and visual storytelling through **Recharts** data visualizations.
* **Zero-Dependency Layout**: High-performance grid and flex layouts built without bulky UI libraries to maximize Lighthouse scores.
