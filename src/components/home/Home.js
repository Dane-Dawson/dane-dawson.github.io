            Born and raised in Austin, Texas, my life has been an adventurous forray into a myriad of experiences thusfar (at least, in my humble opinion). With a lifetime of diverse hobbies and jobs, many browsable below, I've made the recent career shift into tech. With initial experience at SignUp and then as I moved into teaching programming with Flatiron, I have been thankful for the opportnity to find a unique field that is a meeting point for creativity, problem solving, and communication.

            Most recently I have been employed by Flatiron School as a Software Engineer Coach. During that time it was my responsibility to guide and teach students in the fundamentals of programming, with a primary focus in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React. I was also the scrum master and project manager for the cohorts, with duties including coordinating projects, troubleshooting and debugging code, creating materials and overseeing cohort teamwork and communication.
